TESTING:
Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the performance, usability, reliability, scalability, and other non-functional aspects of a software application. Unlike functional testing, which focuses on verifying that the software performs its intended functions, non-functional testing ensures that the software meets quality standards and performs well under various conditions.
