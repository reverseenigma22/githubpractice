TESTING:
Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the performance, usability, reliability, scalability, and other non-functional aspects of a software application. Unlike functional testing, which focuses on verifying that the software performs its intended functions, non-functional testing ensures that the software meets quality standards and performs well under various conditions.



Performance Testing: Measures the speed, responsiveness, and stability of the application under various conditions.
Load Testing: Evaluates the system's behavior under expected user loads to ensure it can handle the anticipated traffic.
Stress Testing: Tests the system's limits by pushing it beyond normal operational capacity to identify breaking points.
Usability Testing: Focuses on the user experience, ensuring the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
Security Testing: Identifies potential vulnerabilities and ensures data protection and secure access.
Compatibility Testing: Verifies the application's compatibility across different devices, browsers, operating systems, and networks.
=======



JMeter: Widely used for performance and load testing.
LoadRunner: A comprehensive tool for stress and scalability testing.
Selenium: Useful for compatibility testing across browsers.
OWASP ZAP: A popular tool for security testing.
